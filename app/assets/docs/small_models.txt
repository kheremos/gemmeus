    Due to the map being covered in water, boats will be required to explore everything.
      WW Boots: Cross between shallow and land (not from boat)
      Skiff: Crosses Shallow or Water
      Ship: Crosses Water or Sea
    boats require maintenance (to prevent map clutter)
      Bigger boats, more maintenance, can be paid by owner or "crew".
